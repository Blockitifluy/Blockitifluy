# Hello There

Hello there, my _internet_ name is Blockitifluy, I have _main_ly been programming as a hobby.

First, starting a game developer on Roblox (I quited in ~2022 due to no more interest in game development) creating games with:

- World Generation,
- Crafting mechanics
- and AIs

## Expirence

However, my programming expirence has been changing recently with full stack web development; First learning plain javascript, typescript, React and finally Solidjs. Although I really only know one language for server development: Python! My current project when writing this is CoffeeCo

### About CoffeeCo

CoffeeCo being an idea was because of ~~Twitter's~~ ~~X's~~ ~~Twitter's~~ new ownership by Elon Musk, I really hated the idea of a website like Twitter, being "The internet's town square", being juggled like some baby's toy is really upsetting (like Elon's ability to have good ideas - IN MY OPINION [^1]). However, I didn't want this be another average new social media app (*cough* *cough* Threads *cough* *cough*) instantly losing traction because it's not like _other girls_. So into not falling for the AAA game sequel trap, the main gimmick of the website is user's personalisation and complete privacy. Plus, the maskot is personified coffee cup (A millennials dream) called Mugo.

[^1]: This is a joke, I don't want to be sued.
